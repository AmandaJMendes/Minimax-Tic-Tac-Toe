# Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe

This was a college assignment for the discipline Algorithms and Data Structures. I was asked to "propose a project in Python, define its requirements and use the graphics library (http://anh.cs.luc.edu/handsonPythonTutorial/graphics.html) for the graphical interface".

In 2020 I took the HarvardX course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python). I've learnt a lot from it, including the minimax algorithm. So, for this project, I decided to get inspiration from the code I had developed during the course and to create a tic-tac-toe using minimax.
